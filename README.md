# Andor's Trail Directory V2

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To run localy

1. You need game sources (values, xml, drawable, raw) at "public" directry. I use "link.bat" to make Symbolic Link.
2. You need have NPM installed. You can get it at https://nodejs.org/en/download/. 
3. Run 'npm install'
4. Run 'npm run gen' to render TMX to JPG for global map pages. It takes 25.5s in MBP. (You can run 'npm run gen graveyard1' to render only one map 'graveyard1')
5. Run 'npm start' for starting local development server.
6. Run 'npm build' to generate production build.
7. To make route from any page to index.html I use "build.bat"

## To run localy (for UNIX-system)

If your system is UNIX, you can ues makefile instead of ".bat". Tested on my MacBookPro.

1. `make link`: Make symbolic link to game resources (values, xml, drawable, raw) at "public" directry.
2. You need have NPM installed. You can get it at https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
3. `npm install`: Install required node.js package from package.json
4. `make gen`: Render TMX to JPG for global map pages. It takes 25.5s in MBP. (You can run `make gen_test` to render only one map 'graveyard1' for test).
5. `make run`: Starting local development server.
6. `make build`: Generate production build.
<!-- 7. To make route from any pages to index.html I use "build.bat" -->
